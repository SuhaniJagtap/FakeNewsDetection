# Fake News Detection using BiLSTM with Attention

This project implements a deep learning model to classify news articles as **real** or **fake** using a Bidirectional LSTM with an attention mechanism. The goal is to tackle misinformation using an NLP-based approach.

## Features

- BiLSTM with Attention for contextual learning
- Cleaned and preprocessed real-world dataset
- Evaluation using Accuracy, F1-score, and ROC-AUC

## Dataset
