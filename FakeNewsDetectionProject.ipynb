Francis announced it himself in a tweet to his nearly 40 million followers on Friday, saying the theme of his message for the Roman Catholic Church s next World Day of Social Communications will be  The truth will set you free. Fake news and journalism for peace.  In Latin, one of the nine languages the pope uses to tweet, that would be  Veritas liberavit vos. Nuntii fallaces et diurniariorum opus ad pacem.  A Vatican statement said the issue was important enough for the pope to address because  fake news contributes to generating and nurturing a strong polarisation of opinions.  A distortion of facts, it said, can have  repercussions at the level of individual and collective behaviour.  Francis said in an interview last year that media that focus on scandals and spread fake news to smear politicians risk becoming like people who have a morbid fascination with excrement. The Vatican statement said the leader of the 1.2 billion member Church wanted to offer  a reflection on the causes, the logic and the consequences of disinformation in the media, and helping to promote professional journalism, which always seeks the truth . The Church s next World Day of Social Communications will be celebrated on May 13. The pope s message will be released on January 24, feast of St Francis de Sales, the patron of journalists. (This version of the story corrected day of Day of Social Communications to May 13 from Jan. 24). \",\n          \"ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Gunmen on motorcycles opened fire on worshippers at the entrance of a Shi ite Muslim mosque in Pakistan s capital Islamabad on Wednesday, killing an intelligence officer at the scene, police said. Three or four attackers on two bikes shot at members of the minority Shi ite community who were leaving evening prayers in a residential neighborhood, police official Ghulam Qasim said. A member of Pakistan s domestic Intelligence Bureau among the worshippers got hit several times and died later in hospital, Qasim said.  We re not sure yet whether it is a sectarian incident,  Qasim added.  The man who died got five or six bullets. That seems to make him a target.   No group immediately claimed responsibility. Attacks are rare in the capital, but Al-Qaeda and Islamic State-affiliated Sunni Muslim sectarian groups are active in the country. Four other people were being treated for bullet wounds, police said. \",\n          \"JAKARTA/ISLAMABAD/CAIRO (Reuters) - Many Muslims around the world expressed dismay on Wednesday at Donald Trump\\u2019s election as U.S. president, saying they feared it might raise tensions between the West and Islam and contribute to radicalization. While Egypt\\u2019s president made an early congratulatory call to Trump, ordinary Muslims were worried that his victory would be a propaganda gift to jihadist groups. Others were apprehensive that the president-elect will implement campaign pledges to clamp down on Muslims entering the United States. \\u201cTrump has espoused highly inflammatory rhetoric against Muslims. Voters there will expect him to fulfill his promises. That makes me worry about the impact on Muslims in the U.S. and in the rest of the world,\\u201d said Yenny Wahid, a prominent mainstream Muslim figure in Indonesia.      The world\\u2019s 1.6 billion Muslims follow a multitude of sects and schools of thought, constitute a majority of the population in countries as varied as Indonesia, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Senegal and Albania, and hold a vast array of political views. Yet Trump\\u2019s previous comments about Muslims, that those from abroad should be barred entry or intensely scrutinized beforehand, and the presence of vocal anti-Islam activists among his supporters, has alarmed many. During a bitter election campaign, Trump also attacked his opponents for what he characterized as their denial about the threat posed by militant Islam, which he said was \\u201ccoming to our shores\\u201d, adding that he would quickly form a commission on it. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi was the first world leader to congratulate Trump on the phone, Sisi\\u2019s office said. Many other Egyptians also welcomed his victory, saying his opponent Hillary Clinton\\u2019s record in office had won her few friends in the most populous Arab country. Clinton, Secretary of State during the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings, is unpopular with many Egyptians. Many of those who backed the revolt saw her as a long-standing supporter of Hosni Mubarak, the autocrat they toppled from power. But elsewhere, other Muslims saw Trump as a hostile figure. \\u201cWhatever happens to America affects everybody and with all these promises of doom by Trump to the blacks, to the Muslims, the minority, so it\\u2019s not something we\\u2019re happy about,\\u201d said Ganiu Olukanga, a Muslim resident of the Nigerian capital Lagos.              Some Muslims, including Wahid, said they feared his election as president might encourage a view that the United States held enmity for Muslims and that this would hinder efforts in Islam to counter radicalization.  \\u201cTrump\\u2019s victory will be an enormous gift to a failing jihadist movement, that will have now have a renewed rallying cry,\\u201d said Ammar Rashid, an academic and member of Pakistan\\u2019s Awami Workers Party on Twitter.  \\u201cIf jihadi ideology has a source of sustenance, it is the image of the US as the evil anti-Muslim crusader. They will milk Trump\\u2019s win dry,\\u201d he added.  In jihadist social media forums, militants said Trump\\u2019s election had merely revealed the true position of the United States toward Muslims. \\u201cThe masks have slipped,\\u201d one wrote.  But some other Muslims were more hopeful, including Umer Daudzai, former Afghan minister of interior, citing the record of Ronald Reagan who was U.S. president from 1981-89. \\u201cRonald Reagan ended the Cold War. I hope Donald Trump will end all wars and become hero of peace in the world,\\u201d he told Reuters.  Among some officials, there were also expressions of concern but the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), the body that represents Muslim states, issued no statement early on Wednesday.  In Indonesia, the most populous Muslim nation, an official from the faith\\u2019s top clerical body there said Trump\\u2019s election could create new tension between the United States and the Islamic world.  \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 Trump had made \\u201cnegative, cynical\\u201d comments about Muslims in the past, Din Syamsuddin, a senior official at the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI), told reporters in Jakarta. \\u201cHe had forgotten that many Americans are immigrants.\\u201d     Saudi Arabia, a U.S. ally that is both birthplace of Islam and home to its holiest places, issued a statement that it had congratulated Trump on his election win without making further comment.  However, Awad al-Qirni, one of its most popular clerics with a Twitter following of two million, said in a social media post after the election - but without referring to Trump directly - that \\u201cAmerica declines into collapse\\u201d and that \\u201cits internal crisis will grow severely\\u201d.  In Pakistan, Sherry Rehman, a senator and former ambassador to Washington, said Trump\\u2019s proposal last year to bar Muslims from entering the U.S. had disturbed many.  \\u201cPakistan obviously cannot rule out engaging with whomever America elects but his anti-Muslim rhetoric may cast a shadow on relations in times of uncertainty,\\u201d he told Reuters on Wednesday.  And in Bangladesh, a government official who asked not to be named said: \\u201cI can\\u2019t think what awaits us. Donald Trump was talking about fighting against Muslims. Are we going to see more wars?\\u201d Among private citizens in Dhaka, some said they hoped the pressure of office would temper Trump\\u2019s views.  \\u201cIt is just unbelievable and I am a bit tense. I hope there will be a difference between Donald Trump and President Donald Trump. President Trump will be more mature than individual Trump,\\u201d Asif Iqbal, a private sector employee, said.  \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"News\",\n          \"politics\",\n          \"Middle-east\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2397,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"April 28, 2017 \",\n          \"Jul 17, 2016\",\n          \"March 2, 2016\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
